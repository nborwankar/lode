A clustering solution for Apache CouchDB using node.js
=====================

lode is beta software and may or may not be under active development ;)

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * node.js (>=0.1.27) (http://nodejs.org/)
 * Apache CouchDB (>= 0.10.1) (http://couchdb.apache.org/)

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^
Unclear...
More options *might* be found by reading the `INSTALL` file.

Security Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should be aware of the security considerations involved with running Apache
CouchDB and consult the README file provided with its distribution. lode will
likely do nothing to protect you in the case of an insecurely configured or
deployed Apache CouchDB system.

Running Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start the server by running

    node lode.js

When Lode starts it should eventually display the following message:

    lode has started. This is excellent news.

Eventually there should be a test suite.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure that Apache CouchDB is running successfully and consult the wiki:

  http://wiki.github.com/tilgovi/lode/

Running as a Daemon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Advice welcome.

Building
--------

No building is necessary. Just launch using node as above.
